# calculator
A simple on-screen calculator using HTML/CSS/JS. It contains functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators ( "add '+', subtract '-', multiply '\*', and divide '/' ). This calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. If you enter a number then an operator and another number that calculation should be displayed if your next input is an operator. The result of the calculation will be used as the first number in a new calculation.
